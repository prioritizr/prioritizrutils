\title{Connected matrix}
\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{\link[raster]{Raster-class}} or 
\code{\link[sp]{Spatial-class}} object. Note that if \code{x} is a 
\code{\link[raster]{Raster-class}} object then it must have only one
layer.}

\item{directions}{\code{integer} If \code{x} is a
\code{\link[raster]{Raster-class}} object, the number of directions
 in which cells should be connected: 4 (rook's case), 8 (queen's case), 
 16 (knight and one-cell queen moves), or 'bishop' to connect cells with
 one-cell diagonal moves.}

\item{distance}{\code{numeric} If \code{x} is a \code{SpatialPoints} object,
the distance that planning units have to be within in order
to qualify as being connected.}
}
\value{
\code{\link{Matrix}{dsCMatrix-class}} object.
}
\description{
Generate a matrix showing which planning units are connected.
}
\details{
This function returns a matrix. Cells along the off-diagonal 
  indicating if two planning units are connected. Cells along the 
  diagonal are zero to reduce computation burden.
