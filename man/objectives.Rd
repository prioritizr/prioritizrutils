add_minimum_set_objective(x)

add_maximum_coverage_objective(x, budget)

add_maximum_representation_objective(x, budget)

add_phylogenetic_representation_objective(x, budget, tree)

\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{\link{ConservationProblem}} object.}

\item{budget}{\code{numeric} value specifying the maximum expenditure of 
the prioritization.}

\item{tree}{\code{\link[ape]{phylo}} object specifying a phylogenetic tree}
}
\description{
The problem objective specifies how the problem \code{\link{targets}} should
be used to generate a solution. All conservation planning problems require
an objective in order to be solved. See below for a list of the problem
objectives that are available.

\describe{

\item{\code{add_minimum_set_objective}}{The objective here is to find the 
    the solution that fulfills all the targets and constraints for 
    the smallest cost. This objective is similar to that used in Marxan.}

\item{\code{add_maximum_coverage_objective}}{The objective here is to
    find the solution that secures as much of each feature as possible
    whilst not exceeding the budget.}

\item{\code{add_maximum_representation_objective}}{The objective here is 
    to find the solution that fulfills as many targets as possible while 
    ensuring that the cost of the solution does not exceed budget and that 
    all constraints are met. This objective was inspired by the conservation
    problem defined in Cabeza et al. XXXX.}

\item{\code{add_phylogenetic_representation_objective}}{This objective is 
    similar to \code{maximum_targets_objective} except that emphasis is 
    placed on preserving as much of a representative sample a phylogenetic
    tree as possible given a budget. This objective requires the
    "ape" R package to be installed.}

\item{\code{default_objective}}{This objective is used when no objective
    has been explicitly specified. This will result in an error because
    \emph{"Let the computer find out" is a poor strategy and usually
    reflects the fact that the researcher did not bother to think
    clearly about the problem of interest and its scientific setting
    (Burnham and Anderson, 2002).}}
