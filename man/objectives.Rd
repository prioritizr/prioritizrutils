\description{
Conservation planning problems involve minimizing or maximizing an objective.
For instance, the planner may require a solution that conserves
enough habitat for each species while minimizing the overall cost of the
reserve network. Alternatively, the planner may require a solution
that maximizes the number of conserved species while ensuring that the cost
of the reserve network does not exceed the budget. The problem objective
specifies the overall goal of the problem.
}
\details{
All conservation planning problems require an objective in order to
be solved. While some users may feel that explicitly defining an objective
for a conservation problem adds some element of arbitrariness or
subjectivity to the decision making process, we remind them that "canned"
decision support tools (such as Marxan or Zonation) also have objectives. The
key difference here is that instead of choosing between different software
programs here the user is explicitly choosing their objective within the
single environment. See below for a list of the objectives that can be
added to a conservation problem.

\describe{

  \item{\code{add_default_objective}}{This objective is used when no objective
    has been explicitly specified by the user. This will result in an error
    because there is no sensible default.}

  \item{\code{add_min_set_objective}}{The objective here is to find the
    the solution that fulfills all the targets and constraints for
    the smallest cost. This objective is similar to that used in Marxan.}

  \item{\code{add_max_cover_objective}}{The objective here is to
    find the solution that secures as much of each feature as possible
    whilst not exceeding the budget.}

  \item{\code{add_max_features_objective}}{The objective here is
    to find the solution that fulfills as many targets as possible while
    ensuring that the cost of the solution does not exceed budget and that
    all constraints are met. This objective was inspired by the conservation
    problem defined in Cabeza et al. XXXX.}

  \item{\code{add_max_phylo_objective}}{This objective is
    similar to \code{add_max_features_objective} except that emphasis is
    placed on preserving as much of a representative sample a phylogenetic
    tree as possible given a budget. This objective requires the
    "ape" R package to be installed.}

# create problem with added maximum phylogenetic representation objective
