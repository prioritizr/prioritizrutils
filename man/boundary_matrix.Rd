\item{x}{\code{\link[raster]{Raster-class}},
\code{\link[sp]{SpatialLines-class}}, or
\code{\link[sp]{SpatialPolygons-class}} object. Note that if \code{x} is a 
\code{\link[raster]{Raster-class}} object then it must have only one
layer.}

\item{edges}{\code{integer} number of edges that each planning unit has when
 argument to \code{x} is a \code{\link[raster]{Raster-class}} object. 
Defaults to 4. Valid values are 4 and 6.}

\description{
Generate a boundary matrix showing the shared and exposed edges of 
planning units. \strong{This function assumes the 
data are in a projected coordinate system where distances can
be correctly calculated. Thus spatial data in a longitude/latitude
coordinate system should be reprojected prior to using this function.}
}
\details{
This function returns a matrix. Cells along the off-diagonal 
  indicating the length of the shared boundary between two planning units. 
  Cells along the diagonal indicate length of a given planning unit's edges 
  that have no neighbors (eg. for edges of planning units found along the 
  coastline).
