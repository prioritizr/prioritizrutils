of a planning unit that can be reserved (eg. set to 0.8 for 80 \%).}

\description{
Conservation planning problems involve making decisions on planning units.
These decisions are then associated with actions (eg. turning a planning 
unit into a protected area). Below is a list of decisions that can be
added to a conservation planning problem.
}
\details{
\describe{

\item{\code{add_binary_decision}}{This is the classic decision of either 
    prioritizing or not prioritizing a planning unit. Typically,
    this decision has the assumed action of buying the planning 
    unit to include in a protected area network.}

\item{\code{add_proportion_decision}}{This is a relaxed decision where
    a part of a planning unit can be prioritized. Typically, this
    this decsion has the assumed action of buying a fraction of 
    a planning unit to include in a protected area network.}

\item{\code{add_semicontinuous_decision}}{This decision is similar to the 
    \code{proportion_decision} except that it has an upper bound 
    parameter. By default, the decision can range from prioritizing 
    none (0 \%) to all (100 \%) of a planning unit. However, a upper 
    bound can be specified to ensure that at most only a fraction 
    (eg. 80 \%) of a planning unit can be preserved. This type of
    decision may be useful when it is not practical to conserve the 
    entire planning unit.}

\item{\code{add_default_decision}}{This decsion represents the default 
    decision if no decision is specified when constructing a conservation
    planning problem. It defaults to using a \code{binary_decision}.}

}

Only a single decision should be added to a 
\code{ConservationProblem} object. \strong{If multiple decisions are added 
to a problem object, then the last one to be added will be used.}

\examples{
# create basic problem and using the default decision (binary)
p <- problem(sim_pu_raster, sim_features) \%>\%
     add_minimum_set_objective() \%>\%
     add_relative_targets(0.1)

# manually specify a binary decision type 
p2 <- p \%>\% add_binary_decision()

# specify a proportion decision type
p3 <- p \%>\% add_proportion_decision()

# specify a semicontinuous decision type
p4 <- p \%>\% add_semicontinuous_decision(upper_limit=0.5)

# solve problem
s <- stack(solve(p), solve(p2), solve(p3), solve(p4))

# plot solutions
plot(s, main = c('default (binary)', 'binary', 'proportion', 
                 'semicontinuous (upper=0.5)'))
