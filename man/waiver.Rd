\value{
\code{object} of class \code{Waiver}.
}
\description{
Create a \code{waiver} object.
}
\details{
This object is used to represent that the user has not manually 
specified a setting, and so defaults should be used. By explictly 
using a \code{waiver()}, this means that \code{NULL} objects can be a 
valid setting. The use of a "waiver" object was inspired by the
\emph{ggplot2} package.
