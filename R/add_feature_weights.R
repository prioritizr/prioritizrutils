#' Add feature weights
#' 
#' Conservation planning problems that aim to maximize the representation of 
#  features may not be able to conserve all of them if the budget is not high 
#' enough. In such budget-limited problems, it may be desirable to prefer the 
#' representation of some features over others. Weights can be be applied to 
#' a problem to favour the representation of some features over others when 
#' making decisions about how the budget should be allocated.
#' 
#' @param x \code{\link{ConservationProblem-class}} object.
#'
#' @param weights \code{numeric} weights. Features with higher weights indicate
#'   that it is more desireable to represent them in the solution. Weights 
#'   cannot have negative values. 
#'
#' @details Weights can only be applied to a budget-limited 
#'   type of planning problem (ie. \code{\link{add_maximum_coverage_objective}},
#'   and \code{\link{add_maximum_representation_objective}}. Weights can also
#'   be applied to problems that aim to maximise phylogenetic representation
#'   (\code{\link{add_phylogenetic_representation_objective}}) to favour the 
#'   representation of specific features over the representation of
#'   some phylogenetic branches.
#'
#' @return \code{\link{ConservationProblem-class}} object with the weights
#'   added to it.
