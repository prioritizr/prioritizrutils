#'
#' It is important to maintain connectivity throughout a reserve network.
#' However, some areas are more difficult for species to traverse then other
#' areas. As a consequence, even though a reserve may protect a contiguous
#' section of land, some species may not be able to disperse throughout
#' the network if some of the land is a high barrier to dispersal. This
#' function adds constraints to ensure that all planning units used to
#' represent features in the conservation problem are connected by planning
#' units that have high connectivity.
#'
#' @param x \code{\link{ConservationProblem-class}} object.
#'
#' @param connectivities \code{object} used to calculate the the connectivity
#'   between planning units. See the Details section for more information.
#'
#' @param thresholds \code{numeric} value representing the minimum
#'   connectivity required between planning units for them to be
#'   considered connected for a given feature. Threshold values
#'   are expressed as a proportion of the total range of connectivity
#'   observed among all planning units for each feature. If a higher
#'   threshold is used, then planning units with lower conductances,
#'   and in turn, lower connectivity will not be considered
#'   to have strong enough connecitivity to form corridors to link
#'   planning units. If \code{thresholds} is a single number then it is used
#'   as the threshold for each feature. Otherwise, if \code{threshold} is a
#'   \code{vector} then it specifies the threshold for each feature.
#'
#' @param ... additional arguments passed to \code{\link{fast_extract}} if
#'   the planning units in argument to \code{x} inherit from a
#'   \code{\link[raster]{RasterStack-class}} object.
#'
#' @details
#'   This function adds constraints to a conservation planning probem to ensure
#'   that all planning units used to represent a given feature are connected to
#'   each other. To acheive this, each planning unit is associated with
#'   condunctance values that describe the ease at which individuals from
#'   each feature can disperse through it. Higher conductance values indicate
#'   that individuals can move planning units with greater ease. The
#'   connectivity between two planning units is calculated as the average
#'   conductance of the two planning units. After the connectivity values have
#'   been calculated, the threshold is applied to determine which planning
#'   units are "connected enough" to be used for linking planning units
#'   occupied by conspecifics. \strong{Adding these constraints to a problem
#'   will dramatically increase the amount of time required to solve it.}
#'
#'   The argument to \code{y} can be used to specify the
#'   the connectivity between different planning units in several different
#'   ways:
#'  \describe{
#'    \item{\code{character} \code{vector}}{If the planning units in
#'      argument to \code{x} inherit from a \code{\link[sp]{Spatial-class}}
#'      object then the argument to code{y} can refer to the
#'      names of the columns in the attribute table that contain the
#'      conductance values for each planning unit for each feature.
#'      It is assumed that the order of the column names in argument to
#'      \code{y} matches the order of the features in the
#'      argument to \code{x}.}
#'
#'    \item{\code{\link[raster]{RasterStack-class}} object}{Each band
#'      corresponds
#'      to each feature in the argument to \code{x}. The cells in each band
#'      denote the conductance of an area. For a given feature, the
#'      condunctance of each planning unit is calculated by overlaying the
#'      planning units in argument to code{x} with the raster data in
#'      argument to \code{conductance}. Note that
#'      if the planning units in argument to \code{x} inherit from a
#'      \code{\link[raster]{Raster-class}} object, then the argument to
#'      code{conductance} must have the same spatial properties as the
#'      planning units (ie. coordinate system, extent, resolution).}
#'
#'   \item{\code{list} of \code{\link[Matrix]{dsCMatrix-class}} matrices}{
#'      Each element in the list corresponds to a different feature. Each
#'      row and column refers to a different planning unit, and the cell
#'      values denote the connectivity between the two planning units. Note
#'      that the connectivity between planning units is assumed to be
#'      symmetric.}
